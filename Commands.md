 In the context of Maven, there are several other useful commands beyond just `clean package` and `clean install`. These commands help manage your project lifecycle, dependencies, and builds more effectively. Here’s an overview of some key Maven commands:

### 1. **`mvn clean`**
   - **Purpose**: This command is used to remove all files generated by the previous build. It deletes the `target/` directory, ensuring that you're working with a clean build state.
   - **When to use**: When you want to ensure no residual files from previous builds affect your current build.
   - **Example**: 
     ``` 
     mvn clean
     ```

### 2. **`mvn compile`**
   - **Purpose**: Compiles your source code into bytecode but does not create a JAR/WAR.
   - **When to use**: When you just want to check that the code compiles without packaging the application.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn compile
     ```

### 3. **`mvn test`**
   - **Purpose**: Runs the unit tests in your project using testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG.
   - **When to use**: To ensure that your code passes all the tests before packaging or installing.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn test
     ```

### 4. **`mvn package`**
   - **Purpose**: Compiles, runs tests, and packages the project into a JAR/WAR without installing it in the local Maven repository.
   - **When to use**: When you need to create the artifact but don't want to install it into the local repository.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn package
     ```

### 5. **`mvn install`**
   - **Purpose**: Compiles, tests, packages, and installs the built artifact (JAR/WAR) into your local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`).
   - **When to use**: When you need your project's artifact to be available for use in other projects.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn install
     ```

### 6. **`mvn validate`**
   - **Purpose**: Validates the project configuration before starting the build process, ensuring all necessary information is available.
   - **When to use**: When you want to make sure the project is correctly set up before attempting to compile or package it.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn validate
     ```

### 7. **`mvn verify`**
   - **Purpose**: Runs any integration tests (if you have any) to verify the validity of the project before packaging.
   - **When to use**: When your project contains integration tests, and you want to validate that everything is working as expected before building the artifact.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn verify
     ```

### 8. **`mvn dependency:resolve`**
   - **Purpose**: Resolves and downloads the project's dependencies from the central repository or other configured repositories.
   - **When to use**: When you want to make sure all project dependencies are downloaded without actually building the project.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn dependency:resolve
     ```

### 9. **`mvn dependency:tree`**
   - **Purpose**: Displays the dependency hierarchy of your project, showing how dependencies are related to each other and identifying any potential conflicts.
   - **When to use**: Useful for debugging when you have conflicting versions of dependencies or transitive dependency issues.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn dependency:tree
     ```

### 10. **`mvn dependency:purge-local-repository`**
   - **Purpose**: Clears selected dependencies from the local Maven repository (`.m2`), forcing Maven to download fresh copies of those dependencies during the next build.
   - **When to use**: When you suspect corruption or outdated dependencies in your local repository.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn dependency:purge-local-repository
     ```

### 11. **`mvn site`**
   - **Purpose**: Generates a project website, including project reports such as test results, code coverage, dependency analysis, etc.
   - **When to use**: When you want to generate detailed reports for your project, often used in corporate environments.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn site
     ```

### 12. **`mvn deploy`**
   - **Purpose**: Packages the project and then uploads the artifact (JAR/WAR) to a remote repository (like Nexus or Artifactory) so that it can be used by other teams or projects.
   - **When to use**: When you're ready to share your artifact with others by deploying it to a central repository.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn deploy
     ```

### 13. **`mvn clean verify`**
   - **Purpose**: Combines the `clean` and `verify` phases, meaning it cleans up the previous build, compiles, runs tests, performs integration tests (if any), and then verifies everything.
   - **When to use**: For a full end-to-end validation of your project, including testing and verification.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn clean verify
     ```

### 14. **`mvn exec:java`**
   - **Purpose**: Runs the main class of your Java application without packaging it into a JAR first.
   - **When to use**: Useful for testing or running your application directly during development.
   - **Example**:
     ``` 
     mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.MainClass"
     ```

### Common Options and Flags:
- **`-DskipTests=true`**: Skips running unit tests during the build process.
   - Example:
     ``` 
     mvn clean package -DskipTests=true
     ```
  
- **`-Dtest=ClassName`**: Runs a specific test class.
   - Example:
     ``` 
     mvn test -Dtest=MyTest
     ```

- **`-X`**: Runs Maven in debug mode, providing more detailed output.
   - Example:
     ``` 
     mvn clean package -X
     ```

### Summary of Use Cases:
- **`mvn clean package`**: For compiling and packaging the app.
- **`mvn clean install`**: For building and installing your project in the local repository.
- **`mvn clean verify`**: For running all tests and validating the build.
- **`mvn site`**: For generating reports.
- **`mvn deploy`**: For publishing your project to a remote repository.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 how Maven handles dependencies like for eg : Apache POI:

1. **`mvn clean package`**:
   - **What it does**: This will create your application's JAR (with dependencies like Apache POI already included if you're using a fat JAR setup).
   - **Dependencies like Apache POI**: Maven will check if these dependencies (like Apache POI) are already available in your local Maven repository (usually located in `~/.m2/repository`).
     - If the **dependencies are already installed** in your local `.m2` folder, it will just use them during the build process.
     - If the dependencies **are not installed**, Maven will **automatically download** them from the central repository (or another configured repository) and store them in your `.m2` folder.
   - **Key point**: After running `mvn clean package`, your application JAR is created, but the external libraries (like Apache POI) are **not installed** anywhere else. They are just used to package the application.

2. **`mvn clean install`**:
   - **What it does**: This will do everything that `package` does (i.e., compile your code, package it, and manage dependencies like Apache POI), but it also **installs your app's JAR** into the local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`).
   - **Dependencies like Apache POI**: As with `package`, Maven will download any required dependencies (like Apache POI) **if they are not already in your local `.m2` folder**. Once downloaded, those dependencies are stored in `.m2` and available for future builds.
   - **Key point**: In addition to creating your application's JAR, Maven will also install this JAR in your local repository so that other projects can reference it as a dependency.

### Key Difference:
- **Both `package` and `install`** will download dependencies like Apache POI if they are not already available in your `.m2` folder.
- **`install`** goes a step further and copies **your own project’s JAR** into the local `.m2` folder, allowing other Maven projects to use it as a dependency.

### Example:
- When you run `mvn clean package`:
   - Apache POI (if not already downloaded) will be downloaded and stored in `.m2` for your build.
   - Your Spring Boot app will be packaged into a JAR in the `target/` folder, but nothing will be installed in `.m2` for your project.

- When you run `mvn clean install`:
   - Apache POI (if not already downloaded) will be downloaded and stored in `.m2`.
   - Your Spring Boot app will be packaged and then **installed in `.m2`**, so other projects can reference your app’s JAR as a dependency.

### Important:
- **Dependencies (like Apache POI)**: These are always downloaded (if not present) by either `package` or `install` and placed in your `.m2` folder.
- **Your Project's JAR**: Only the `install` command installs your own project’s JAR into `.m2` for reuse in other projects.
